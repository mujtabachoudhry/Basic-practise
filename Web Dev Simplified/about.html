            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>
                Youth Club (YC) is a non-profit, non-sectarian, non-political organization,
                which provides a unique platform for the youth and provides them avenues to
                channel their potential in accordance with Islamic values. Since its inception
                in 2011, Youth Club is working to create well-balanced individuals, who are not
                only skilled in their respective fields but also recognize and fulfil their
                religious obligations and participate actively in their communities.
            </p>
            <p>Here is what the founders of youth club envisioned it to be years ago:</p>
            <pre><ul>
                <li>To give an environment to
the youth to understand
islam in its true essense
and spirit.</li>
                <li>Be a unique platform for
youth, by youth according
to their psychological needs</li>
                <li>An enriching platform for the
young who not only want to
have fun but also look forward
to practicing Muslim who is a
future leader.</li>
                <li>To train youth for exemplary
characters for the much needed
revival of a true islamic society.</li>
                <li>To equip youth with a
vision & lifestyle that
drives them out of the
time wastage activities
and connects them with
Allah. </li>
            </ul></pre>
